Project 2 is a indiviualized project. I am creating a website for classic VW parts where users can locate parts through a network of parts sellers. 

My website allows users to: 
- browse parts for sale
- list parts for sale
- search for parts to buy
- obtain information about upcoming events in the area
- browse the gallery 


Technologies used: 
- sequelize
- node express
- MVC paradigm and server-side API.
- Use a Node and Express Web Server;
- MySQL Database an ORM (not necessarily Sequelize);
- Have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data;
- Be deployed using Heroku (with Data);
- Utilize at least one new library, package, or technology that we havenâ€™t discussed;


No third party API is utilized at this time.
