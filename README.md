Project 2 is a indiviualized project. I am creating a website for hard to find classic VW parts. 

My website allows users to: 
- simply browse for fun without signing up or logging in
- browse parts for sale
- list parts for sale
- search for parts to buy
- obtain information about upcoming events in the area
- browse the gallery 
- go to video links

Target audience: Classic VW vehicles enthusiasts, DIY home mechanics, repair shops, hobbyists.

Problems: Parts for old VW vehicles are getting very difficult to find because they don't make them anymore. Looking for good working parts is a big chore an has to be done deligently. Searching for used parts world-wide is necessary. 

How it works: When a user wants to search for parts, there is a search field on the front page. The search will find the closest match and it will go to the detail page. If the user decided to buy it, he/she can click on the buy cutton and it will bring the user to the seller's information page. However, to buy a part or to sell parts, the user needs to login.

Technologies used: 
- sequelize
- node express
- passport for login authentication
- MVC paradigm and server-side API.
- Used a Node and Express Web Server;
- MySQL Database an ORM 
- api routes: GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data;
- Heroku
- used my own api, no third party API is utilized at this time.
